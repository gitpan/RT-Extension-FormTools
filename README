NAME
    RT-Extension-FormTools - Help write multi-page ticket creation wizards

DESCRIPTION
    This extension provides scaffolding to make it simpler to create guided
    multi-page ticket creation wizards. It merely provides useful Mason
    components to accomplish this task; it does not provide any UI.
    Administrators may use this extension as a base upon which to write
    their own forms in Mason.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0 and 4.2

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::FormTools');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::FormTools));

        or add RT::Extension::FormTools to your existing @Plugins line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

COMPONENTS
    See ex/RT-Example-FormTools/ for an example extension written using this
    module.

/FormTools/Form
    The top-level component that most elements will call, as a wrapper:

        <&|/FormTools/Form, next => "/URI/of/next/page" &>
        (form elements)
        </&>

    It requires that the next page in the wizard be passed as the next
    parameter; this may be empty at the end of the wizard. It renders page
    decoration (using /Elements/Header). It assumes that the queue will be
    stored in $m-notes('queue')>.

/FormTools/Field
    Renders a field in the form. It takes the name of a core field, or CF
    name:

        <& /FormTools/Field, name => 'Requestors' &>

    Valid core fields include:

    Requestors
    Cc
    AdminCc
    Subject
    Content
    Attach
    Due

    Any other argument to name is assumed to be the name of a custom field.

  /FormTools/Next
    Renders the "Next page" button.

  /FormTools/ShowChoices
    Shows the values that have already been submitted.

FUNCTIONS
    In addition to the Mason components, this module provides a number of
    functions which may be useful to call from Mason templates.

  is_core_field field_name
    Checks if the given field_name is is a field that we consider 'core' to
    RT (subject, AdminCc, etc) rather than something which should be treated
    as a Custom Field.

    Naming a Custom Field Subject would cause serious pain with FormTools.

  validate_cf CF, ARGSRef
    Takes a given RT::CustomField object and a hashref of query parameters,
    and returns a list of a boolean of if the custom field validates,
    followed by a list of errors.

  email_is_privileged email_address
    Returns true if the given email address belongs to a privileged user.

  has_value value
    Returns true if the value is defined and non-empty.
